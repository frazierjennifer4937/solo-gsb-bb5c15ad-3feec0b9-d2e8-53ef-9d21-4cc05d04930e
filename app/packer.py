"""Guillotine-style (edge-to-edge) cutting layout engine.

Model
-----
* Every cut is a straight line spanning the full width or height of the
  sub-rectangle being cut (guillotine / 铡刀 rule).
* Every cut consumes ``kerf`` units of material (the blade/切缝 width).
  The kerf strip sits between the two children of a cut node.
* Pieces may be rotated 90 degrees.
* If the leftover after a cut would be narrower than the kerf it cannot
  yield any usable piece (the blade would eat it entirely), so it is
  treated as trim loss and not represented by a node.

The layout is built with the classic free-rectangle guillotine heuristic:
pieces are sorted largest-first and each piece is placed into the free
rectangle with the best short-side fit, splitting that rectangle with
guillotine cuts.  Because free rectangles are only ever produced by
splitting, the result is always expressible as a binary cut tree.

Locked placements
------------------
Requests may pin some pieces to fixed coordinates.  The locked layout on
the first sheet must itself be guillotine-separable under the same kerf
rules: recursively, a region is either empty, a single piece, or a full
span kerf-wide empty strip separates it into two non-empty groups.
LockedLayoutError is raised when no such decomposition exists; the error
names the pieces of the smallest region that could not be separated.

Cut limit
---------
``max_cuts_per_sheet`` caps the number of cut nodes in any sheet's tree.
The locked layout on the first sheet counts towards the cap and is
rejected when its tree alone exceeds it.  While packing, a free rectangle
is only used when the split it takes keeps its sheet within the cap, and
equal fits prefer the split adding fewer cuts.  A piece that cannot be
cut from a blank sheet within the cap is rejected up front.

Gripper zone
------------
A request may reserve a full-span strip along one stock edge (the
press gripper / 叼口).  The strip is cut off every sheet with one
kerf-consuming guillotine cut and becomes a permanent ``waste`` leaf;
that separator cut counts towards ``cut_count`` and
``max_cuts_per_sheet``.  All packing happens in the remaining inner
rectangle.  When the inner rectangle is unusable (a non-positive
dimension), or a pinned piece enters the strip or straddles the
separator cut, GripperZoneError is raised.
